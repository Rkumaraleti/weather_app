Hello Developer!

# weather_app
An App to know weather details of any location - Default Location is user's location

This is a very small project to fetch weather details from open weather app's free api.

Default settings - Will Fetch user location's weather information.
Custom - In the input block, add any city name to get that city's weather information.

Yes! They could be some messy code and I would love to have someone pull a better version of mine.

Happy Coding!
