Hello Developer!

# weather_app
An App to know weather details of any location - Default Location is user's location

This is a very small project to fetch weather details from open weather app's free api.

Default settings - Will Fetch user location's weather information.
Custom - In the input block, add any city name to get that city's weather information.

Now This is a Hybrid Weather App.
1. You can use it as a web app by going to the website.
2. You can make it your browser extension.

Guide to make Extension: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-chrome-extension/#manifest-json-file
note: I've already included the manifest.json file so just do the rest to have this extension in you browser.

Developer? : You can use this same project just by changing API key that you have from [openweatherapp](https://openweathermap.org/api)https://openweathermap.org/api. Create your own API Key and update it in app.js -> weather_api_key.

Happy Coding!
